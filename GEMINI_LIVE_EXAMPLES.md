## ✨ **What Your AI Assistant Now Does**

### **Example 1: Baby Born Query**
**User Input:** "My wife just had a baby"

**Gemini Pro Response:**
> Congratulations on your new addition to the family! 🎉 That's wonderful news! Having a baby is such a joyous occasion.
>
> To get started with all the important paperwork, you'll definitely need a **Birth Certificate** for your little one. This is a crucial document that legally registers your baby's birth and provides proof of identity. It's essential for things like school admissions, passport applications, and many other official processes throughout your child's life. Think of it as their very first important official ID!
>
> You'll also want to consider applying for a **BPL Certificate** if you meet the income requirements. This certificate can help your family access various government welfare schemes, potentially offering assistance with healthcare, subsidized food, and educational benefits. It can really make a difference in supporting your growing family.

### **Example 2: Starting Business Query**
**User Input:** "I want to start a business"

**Gemini Pro Response:**
> That's wonderful news! Starting your own business is a big step, and I'm here to help you navigate the process. To legally operate your business within our Gram Panchayat area, you'll need a **Trade License**. 🎉
>
> Think of the Trade License as your official permission slip to run your business. It ensures you're operating legally, which is important for a number of reasons. For example, it allows you to open a business bank account, apply for loans, and ensures you're complying with all the necessary regulations. It also gives your business a sense of legitimacy and builds trust with your customers.
